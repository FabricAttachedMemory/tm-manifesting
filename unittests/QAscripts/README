= Specifying the DNS Domain

  This used to be done with the TMDOMAIN variable in /etc/tmms.  Now use the
  "domains { publicData: ....}" field in TMCF.  For FAME, see the new 
  variable PXE_SUBNET in the tmms reference file.


= Prepping the ToRMS to serve ARM PXE

  DEPRECATED: should be done by "setup environment".  There's other useful
  information here so keep reading.

  sudo apt-get install grub-efi-arm64-bin

This is NOT grub-efi:amd64, which would replace grub-pc, will
probably break your system.  Nor is it grub-efi-arm64, which collides
with grub-pc but doesn't break your system.
It gives you the auxiliary modules under /usr/lib/grub/arm64-efi/*.mods
to build an EFI boot manager:

grub-mkimage --format=arm64-efi --output=grub4tm.pxe \
	--prefix='(pxe)/boot/grub' efinet ...

OR: pick up the ready-to-run PXE EFI GRUB at

http://hlinux-deejay.us.rdlabs.hpecorp.net/l4tm/dists/catapult/main/uefi/grub2-arm64/current/grubnetaa64.efi.signed

or unpack the package

apt-get download grub-efi-arm64-signed:arm64

Drop the ".signed" part.  It has all the modules as built by the command

debian/build-efi-images

As found after "apt-get download grub2:arm64"
