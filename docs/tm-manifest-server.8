.SH FILES
The server reads \fB/etc/tmms\fR by default.  The default file contains
comments to guide you in its customization.  By default the TMMS suite
puts config files and images under /etc/tmms in the following directories:

.PP
.TP
dnsmasq
Files for the dnsmasq assigned to the payload port declared in /etc/tmms.
The lead file, ethX.conf, includes other files.

.TP
sys-images
The build directory for manifested images, further broken down by node.

.TP
tftp
The root directory of the TFTP server functionality of dnsmasq.  It
contains the EFI boot support plus menus, kernels, and root file system
images for each bound node.

.SH  
/etc/tmconfig is the "node topology" config file. It usually comes from a
wonder land, but can also be generated using tm-librarian utils, which is a
dependency for tm-manifesting.  This file is also used by the librarian.

.SH LOG FILES

Various components generate their own (possibly rotating) log files.

.PP
.TP
/var/log/tmms.ethX.log
The main log file driven by tm-manifest-server

.TP
/var/lib/tmms/dnsmasq/ethX.log
From the dnsmasq providing PXE services to the nodes.

.TP
/var/lib/tmms/sys-images/golden/vmdebootstrap.log

.TP
/var/lib/tmms/sys-images/nodeXX/build.log
