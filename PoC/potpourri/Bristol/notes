1. Program will not start, it's missing package "requests". 
   The recommendation is to "pip install requests".  Installing
   "pip" requires almost sixty more packages to be installed.

   As it turns out, "python-request" for 2.7 already exists in L4TM
   so pip is not needed at all.

   SUGGESTED FIX: use L4TM packages whenever possible

2. Have to edit source code to change API URL.

   SUGGESTED FIX: command line arguments

3. INTEGRATION TEST #0 , but it's really network misconfiguration.  The API
   service was never contacted.

   FIX
